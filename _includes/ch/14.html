  <h2 id='chapter-14'>14. Modules</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      We've now seen lots of examples of functions throughout this book. We've seen how we can define anonymous functions (in Chapter 5):
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> hello = fn (place) -> "Hello #{place}!"
hello.("World")
"Hello World!"</code></pre>

    <p>
      And we've seen how we can call functions from already defined modules (in Chapter 8):
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> String.downcase("HELLO BUT QUIETLY")
"hello but quietly"</code></pre>

    <p>
      But what we haven't seen yet is how to define our own modules, or even <em>why</em> we would want to do that. The why is the simple part: we define functions inside of modules to keep them separate from other functions; modules are a convenient way of grouping functions. Here's a refresher that recycles the description used in Chapter 8:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The functions that Elixir provides are separated into something akin to kitchen drawers or toolboxes, called <em>modules</em>. Whereas in your top kitchen drawer you might have forks, knives, sporks, and spoons (like every sensible person's kitchen does), and in another you might have measuring cups, and in another tea towels, in Elixir the functions to work with the different kinds of data are separated into different modules. This makes finding functions to work with particular kinds of data in Elixir very easy.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We haven't yet built a complex enough system to require us to put functions inside of modules, or to even want to write our own functions. That changes in this chapter! A rumbling occurs behind us, and slightly to our left. It's Izzy vibrating with anticipation. It's a weird and unearthly sound, but we'll roll with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter will show you how to write new modules for the purpose of grouping together functions, and we'll also cover a special kind of map called a <em>struct</em>. In fact, we'll write <em>TWO</em> modules. Let's go!
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Home, Sweet Home</h3>

    <p>
      The system that we're going to start writing in this chapter will be modelling a home automation system for lights. When I say "modelling", I mean we will be writing some Elixir code that will simulate a home automation system. It'll be a fictional house, instead of a real one. But if we were working on a real home automation system in Elixir, it might work something like this one. We'll use this same code in the next two chapters as well.</p>
    <p>

    </p>In our fictional house, there are fictional rooms, each with a set of fictional lights. It looks like this:
    </p>

    <div class='todo'>
      Image for a house here.
    </div>

    <p>
      Red circles here indicate lights that are off, where green ones indicate on.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this house, we want to be able to go into a room and turn on one particular light, or to turn on <em>all</em> the lights in that room. Maybe when we go into the dining room, we want to turn on all the lights not only so we can see what we're eating, but so we have the best lighting for our Instagram photos too when we cook an especially photogenic meal.
    </p>

    <div class='todo'>
      Dining room with all lights on.
    </div>

    <p>
      But maybe we want to go into another room later that evening -- after our photogenic meal is devoured -- perhaps the lounge room and we want to watch TV. We turn the TV on, but then also want the small lamp on in the room to provide some more light. We don't want to turn on <em>all</em> the lights in that room. We only want to turn on the lamp.
    </p>

    <div class='todo'>
      Lounge room with small lamp on.
    </div>

    <p>
      What we will look at in this chapter is how we could write some Elixir code that will be able to turn on or off a whole room's set of lights, or individual lights.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Let there be light</h3>

    <p>
      In our Elixir code, we need to create something that will keep a track of a light. Here's what we know so far:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lights can be on, or off</li>
      <li>Lights have a room, like "dining room" or "lounge room"</li>
      <li>Lights can have a name, like "small lamp"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But how can we represent this in Elixir? What kind of data type can we use?
    </p>

    <p>
      Izzy's unearthly vibration stops, deadening the air. We had become so accustomed to the noise that its loss leaves us with a very mild sense of melancholy. Then she pipes up: "A map might work. On or off, room name and name all look like they could be keys and values. Here, let me try an example."
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> light = %{
  status: "on",
  room: "Lounge Room",
  name: "Small Map"
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      A map does seem to be quite a good type of data to use here. It allows us to keep a track of the light's status, the room that the light is in, as well as a name specific to the light itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we want to change any one of the light's attributes, we can use <em>pipe merging</em> (from Chapter 10) to do so:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{light | status: "off"}
%{name: "Small Map", room: "Lounge Room", status: "off"}</code></pre>


    <p>
      This code is a little long to write, so we might want to make a function for it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> turn_off = fn (light) -> %{light | status: "off"} end </code></pre>

    <p>
      Now we can turn lights off by calling this function:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> turn_off.(light)
%{name: "Small Map", room: "Lounge Room", status: "off"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Similarly, we can write another function to turn the lights on:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> turn_on = fn (light) -> %{light | status: "on"} end
#Function<6.127694169/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex> turn_on.(light)
%{name: "Small Map", room: "Lounge Room", status: "on"}</code></pre>


    <p>
      Finally, we can create one more function that will toggle a light's status, depending on whether the "status" is on or off, using pattern matching (as we originally saw in Chapter 6):
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> toggle = fn
  %{status: "on"} = light -> %{light | status: "off"}
  %{status: "off"} = light -> %{light | status: "on"}
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      We now have these three functions, <code>turn_off</code>, <code>turn_on</code> and <code>toggle</code>. But they aren't connected together, they're all floating out there. If we added further functions, how would we know if those functions were for lights, or for rooms? It might be hard to tell.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we can do to group these functions together is to move them into a module.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Light module</h3>

    <p>
      We're now going to move out of <code>iex</code>, and write some code in a new file. This will make it easier to define our very first custom module, the <code>Light</code> module. We'll write this code in a new file called <code>light.exs</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  def turn_on(light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end

  def turn_off(light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end

  def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end

  def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      This code is some of the longest Elixir code that we've written and it looks slightly alien from the Elixir we're used to. Izzy asks: "What is that <code>defmodule</code> thing, and how is it different from <code>def</code>"? Let's walk through it bit by bit.
    </p>

    <h4>Simple module functions</h4>

    <p>
      The first line here starts our module definition, and the <code>do</code> starts a block of code for the module. Inside the module, we can then define functions using <code>def</code>. When we've defined functions in the past, we would define them like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> turn_off = fn (light) -> %{light | status: "off"} end
iex> turn_on = fn (light) -> %{light | status: "on"} end</code></pre>

    <p>
      These functions from the past are defined outside of a module, and must be defined like this, with a variable on the left hand side of an equals sign to name the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when we're inside a module, we must define them like this:
    </p>


    <pre><code>def turn_on(light) do
  %{light | status: "on"}
end

def turn_off(light) do
  %{light | status: "off"}
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      The arguments stay within the circle brackets, but move to be next to the name of the function. We then use a <code>do</code> / <code>end</code> block here to define the functions' bodies, rather than <code>-></code> / <code>end</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These two functions work the same way however we define them. The <code>turn_on</code> function sets the <code>status</code>'s value to <code>on</code>, and the <code>turn_off</code> function sets it to <code>off</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Pattern matching with module functions</h4>

    <p>
      When we get to <code>toggle</code>, something special happens:
    </p>

    <pre><code>def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "off"}
end

def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "on"}
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      This looks almost like we're defining the same function twice. And technically, we are. Both functions are taking a single argument. Because these <code>toggle</code> functions are inside the <code>Light</code> module and because they both take one argument (a light), we would refer to both of these functions as <code>Light.toggle/1</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These two functions are equivalent to this other syntax that we have seen:
    </p>

  <pre><code>toggle = fn
  %{status: "on"} = light -> %{light | status: "off"}
  %{status: "off"} = light -> %{light | status: "on"}
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      In both cases, we use <em>pattern matching</em> to match the argument passed to the function. If the argument is a map containing a <code>status</code> key that's an atom, and that key has a string value of "on", it will match the first function clause and not the second:
    </p>

<pre><code>def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "off"}
end

<span class='unused-clause'>def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "on"}
end</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      But if the value of <code>status</code> was "off" instead, then the first function clause wouldn't match, but the 2nd one would:
    </p>

<pre><code><span class='unused-clause'>def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "off"}
end</span>

def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "on"}
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      As we can see here, pattern matching comes in handy. Rather than us (as humans) knowing whether or not our light is on or off, and then figuring out which function to use, we can rely on <code>toggle</code> (the computer) to figure it out for us, and to take the right actions on our light.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <header>How to tell functions apart</header>

      <p>
        One final thing to point out here is that back in Chapter 8 we had this large text explaining how functions can be different from one another:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Functions not only differ by name, but also by the number of arguments that they take.</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We've now got an example where the function's name <em>and</em> the number of arguments are identical. The <code>Light.toggle/1</code> function has the same name, and the same number of arguments, but the two functions are actually different. So this phrasing (and our understanding) needs updating to include the pattern matching that we now know Elixir is capable of:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Functions not only differ by name, but also by the number of arguments that they take, as well as the <em>pattern</em> of those arguments.</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        There are now <em>three</em> things that make Elixir functions unique:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The function's name</li>
        <li>How many arguments that function takes, and;</li>
        <li>The <em>pattern</em> of those arguments</li>
      </ol>
    </aside>

    <p>
      We've now talked at (extreme) length about the <code>Light</code> module, but we haven't actually used it yet. We've written the code in <code>light.exs</code>, and now it's time to use it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Using the Light module</h3>

    <p>
      It's time to use this <code>Light</code> module we've crafted. We must first navigate in the terminal to the directory where <code>light.exs</code> is. On my computer, it is at <code>~/code/joy-of-elixir</code> and so I type this to get there:
    </p>

<pre><code class='hljs plain'>cd ~/code/joy-of-elixir</code></pre>

    <p>
      Once there, we can start <code>iex</code> and load our module with the <code>c</code> helper from <code>iex</code>:
    </p>

<pre><code>iex> c "light.exs", "."
[Light]</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>c</code> helper's name is short for "compile". Using <code>c</code> like this will load the code from <code>light.exs</code> into our <code>iex</code> session, making the <code>Light</code> module and its functions available to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we run <code>c</code>, it outputs a list of the modules that were loaded by compiling the file, which we see here as <code>[Light]</code>, since there's only the <code>Light</code> module in that file.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're passing a second argument to <code>c</code> here which is a path where our compiled module should go. The dot (<code>.</code>) here means "the current directory", so where we ran the <code>iex</code> command from. When we run this command, Elixir will compile our module to a file called <code>Elixir.Light.beam</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could also compile this file with <code>c "light.exs"</code> -- only a single argument to the <code>c</code> function call. This will still compile the module, but every time we go back into <code>iex</code>, we will need to re-compile the module to use it. By running it with two arguments -- <code>c "light.exs", "."</code>, we can enter and leave <code>iex</code> and always have our <code>Light</code> module available.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this file compiled, we can start to use to use the <code>Light</code> module. Let's try the <code>Light.turn_on/1</code> function:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "off", name: "Lamp"} |> Light.turn_on
%{status: "on", name: "Lamp"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      "Hey, it works!", exclaims Izzy. She of little faith. This <code>Light.turn_on/1</code> function has changed the <code>:status</code> key within our map to <code>"on"</code>, and has left the <code>:name</code> key unchanged. Let's try turning a light off:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "on", name: "Lamp"} |> Light.turn_off
%{status: "off", name: "Lamp"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      The light's status is now <code>"off"</code>. Excellent! We can even pipe chain these functions together to turn the light on and off:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "off", name: "Lamp"} |> Light.turn_on |> Light.turn_off
%{status: "off", name: "Lamp"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      We can do this because each of the functions takes a map and changes the value associated with the <code>status</code> key to either "on" or "off". All of these functions not only <em>take</em> a map as an argument, but they also return a map, and so we can chain these functions together infinitely if we wanted. We would, in effect, be flicking the lights on and off really quickly -- something our parents told us not to do as children. Let's try to do this with a pipe chain of <code>Light.toggle/1</code> functions:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "off", name: "Lamp"} |> Light.toggle |> Light.toggle |> Light.toggle
%{status: "on", name: "Lamp"}</code></pre>

    <div class='todo'>
      Short diagram showing input and output for each toggle invocation.
    </div>

    <p>
      This is so much fun! We wrote our very first Elixir module, put some functions in it and it's working perfectly. We can now turn lights on or off, or toggle them. But what if we only wanted to make it so a light could be toggled? Let's take a brief look at what that might look like.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Public and private functions</h3>

    <p>
      We currently have three functions within the <code>Light</code> module: <code>Light.turn_on/1</code>, <code>Light.turn_off/1</code> and <code>Light.toggle/1</code>. We're now going to change this module so that the <code>Light.toggle/1</code> function is the only function that can be called from outside this module. We will do this by turning the <code>Light.turn_on/1</code> and <code>Light.turn_off/1</code> functions into<em>private functions</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Functions defined in Elixir modules with <code>def</code> are <em>public</em> functions. That means that we can call them from anywhere else within Elixir code. When a function is <em>private</em>, it can only be referred to from within the same module. We might want to do this to simplify the interface to our module. We're doing that now: we're simplifying it by bringing down the number of functions from 3 to 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      A real-world example of a public / private "function" is the inner workings of a light switch. The public example is the little plastic switch or button we can use to turn the light on or off. The private example happens behind the scenes: flicking the switch one way connects two wires together and completes a circuit. Flicking it the other way breaks the connection.
    </p>

    <div class='todo'>
      Basic circuit image of wires connecting for a light here.

    </div>

    <p>
      When we turn on or off a light, we don't think about wires connecting -- although now you might!
    </p>

    <p>
      We're now going to turn the <code>Light.turn_on/1</code> and <code>Light.turn_off/1</code> functions into private functions. We can do this by moving these functions to the bottom of our <code>Light</code> module, and defining them with <code>defp</code> instead of <code>def</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end

  def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end

  defp turn_on(light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end

  defp turn_off(light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end
end</code></pre>

  <p>
    The order of these function definitions are important. At the top of Elixir modules, we must define the <em>public</em> functions. Then when we're done defining the public functions, we then define the <em>private</em> ones. This helps other people who are reading our code: the public ones are the ones they're probably interested in using, and so it makes sense for them to be defined first.
  </p>

  <p>
    One funny thing with this code is that we've defined <code>turn_on</code> and <code>turn_off</code> as private functions, but we're not using these at all within the module. If we launch <code>iex</code> now and compile our <code>light.exs</code> file, Elixir will warn us about this:
  </p>

  <pre><code class='plain hljs'>iex> c "light.exs", "."
<span class='console-yellow'>warning</span>: function turn_off/1 is unused
  light.exs:14

<span class='console-yellow'>warning:</span> function turn_on/1 is unused
  light.exs:10

[<span class='console-blue'>Light</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Elixir is able to determine that these functions are unused by checking our code. Warnings like these can be incredibly helpful for getting rid of code that we no longer rely on. But in this case, the warnings are happening because we've moved these two functions to be private functions, and we're not using them in either of the <code>Light.toggle/1</code> clauses. Let's fix this up:
  </p>

  <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
    light |> turn_off
  end

  def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
    light |> turn_on
  end

  defp turn_on(light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end

  defp turn_off(light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      If we re-compile the <code>light.exs</code> file with the <code>c</code> helper, we will no longer see the warnings:
    </p>

    <pre><code class='plain hljs'>iex> c "light.exs", "."

<span class='console-yellow'>warning:</span> redefining module Light (current version loaded from ./Elixir.Light.beam)
light.exs:1

[<span class='console-blue'>Light</span>]</code></pre>

    <p>
      We do see a different warning though. This is because we're re-defining the module <code>Light</code> by re-compiling this file again. It is nothing to particularly worry about here, and we can safely ignore this. We're re-compiling this module so that the newest code is available within our <code>iex</code> prompt. If we did not re-compile this module, <code>iex</code> would only know about the last version that we compiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we're in <code>iex</code>, let's try using our <code>Light.toggle/1</code> function again:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "on"} |> Light.toggle
%{status: "off"}
iex> %{status: "off"} |> Light.toggle
%{status: "on"}
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Great, that seems to be all in order. But what happens if we try to use the now-private functions, <code>Light.turn_off/1</code> or <code>Light.turn_on/1</code>?
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "on"} |> Light.turn_off
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function Light.turn_off/1 is undefined or private
  Light.turn_off(%{status: "on"})</span>
iex> %{status: "off"} |> Light.turn_on
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function Light.turn_on/1 is undefined or private
  Light.turn_on(%{status: "off"})</span>
</code></pre>

    <p>
      We know for a fact that these functions are defined, as we defined them ourselves. We know that they're defined as private functions, and that's exactly what Elixir is telling us now. We cannot use these functions in <code>iex</code>, because we are outside of the module. Private functions can only be accessed from within the module itself -- never from the outside. We choose to make functions private to simplify what our module exposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's look at one final feature of modules before we round out this chapter. That feature is called <em>structs</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Light struct</h3>

    <p>
      So far, we have been using maps to represent our lights and then passing these maps through to the functions from the <code>Light</code> module:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %{status: "off", name: "Lamp"} |> Light.toggle
%{status: "on", name: "Lamp"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      We're now going to take the time to look at a data type that is similar to a map, called a <em>struct</em>. The word "struct" is shorted for "structured data"; it's a map, but a particular <em>type</em> of map, where each map of the same type will share the same structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      A struct has a set of key-value pairs just like a map, but a struct's keys are limited to only a certain set. Let's look at how we would define a struct now within the <code>Light</code> module. At the top of the module, we can use the <code>defstruct</code> keyword to define a struct:
    </p>

    <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  defstruct [status: "off"]
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      Let's start <code>iex</code> and compile our <code>light.exs</code> file:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> c "light.exs"</code></pre>

    <p>
      To use this struct, we use a similar syntax to how we would create a new map:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %Light{}
%Light{status: "off"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      The difference is here that we put the name of the module where the struct is defined between the <code>%</code> and the opening curly bracket. In our <code>defstruct</code> call, we have defined a default value for <code>status</code>: <code>"off"</code>. So when we've now built this new struct with <code>%Light{}</code>, it will already have a <code>:status</code> key set to <code>"off"</code>.

    <p>
      This is one of the advantages of structs over maps: structs can have default values.
    </p>

    <p>Another advantage is that structs are limited to the keys specified within the <code>defstruct</code> definition. If we attempt to add a <code>:name</code> key when we define a new <code>%Light{}</code> struct, we'll see an error occur:</p>

    <pre><code>iex> %Light{name: "Lamp"}
<span class='console-red'>** (KeyError) key :name not found
  expanding struct: Light.__struct__/1
  iex:3: (file)</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      We're seeing this error because the struct is only supposed to have a <code>:status</code> key. Any additional keys will not be allowed within this struct. This can be helpful in order to keep structs relatively simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might also recognise the <code>Light.__struct__/1</code> part of this error message as being something that looks like a function. You would be correct! When we use <code>%Light{}</code>, that use the <code>Light.__struct__/1</code> function underneath, which is automatically defined by Elixir when we use <code>defstruct</code>. We can use this function too:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> Light.__struct__(status: "on")
%Light{status: "on"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      But this is much longer than writing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %Light{status: "on"}
%Light{status: "on"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And so we should stick with the latter syntax instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Structs are beneficial because we can specify default values for certain keys, and we can limit the number of keys that a struct can have, but with a map we cannot. There's also one more place that we can use structs: to pattern match on them for function defintions.
    </p>

    <h4>Using structs with functions</h4>

    <p>
      We now have some functions within our <code>Light</code> module, and we are using <code>defstruct</code> which will let us define structured maps to represent our lights. We can combine these two together.
    </p>

    <p>
      But first, a little bit about why. Our code for <code>Light.toggle/1</code> will break if we use it in weird ways -- like if we pass it a map which <em>does not</em> have a <code>:status</code> key:
    </p>

    <pre><code class='hljs plain'>iex> %{} |> Light.toggle
<span class='console-red'>** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Light.toggle/1</span>

The following arguments were given to Light.toggle/1:

    # 1
    %{}

    Attempted function clauses (showing 2 out of 2):

    def toggle(<span class='console-red'>%{status: "on"} = light</span>)
    def toggle(<span class='console-red'>%{status: "off"} = light</span>)

<span class='console-red'>light.exs:4: Light.toggle/1</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      As we can see from the error output, this error is happening because <em>both</em> of the clauses for <code>Light.toggle/1</code> do not match:
    </p>

    <pre><code><span class='unused-clause'>def toggle(%{status: "on"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "off"}
end

def toggle(%{status: "off"} = light) do
  %{light | status: "on"}
end</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      Neither clause matches because there is no <code>:status</code> key with a value of either "on" or "off" within the map that we are passing to <code>Light.toggle/1</code>. We can fix this by making our functions match on the <code>Light</code> structs, rather than simple maps. The <code>Light</code> struct <em>always</em> includes a <code>:status</code> key. To make our code do this, we'll change our <code>light.exs</code> code to this:
    </p>

    <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  defstruct [:name, status: "off"]

  def toggle(%Light{status: "on"} = light) do
    light |> turn_off
  end

  def toggle(%Light{status: "off"} = light) do
    light |> turn_on
  end

  defp turn_on(%Light{} = light) do
    %{light | status: "on"}
  end

  defp turn_off(%Light{} = light) do
    %{light | status: "off"}
  end
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      With the module changed, we can re-compile it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> c "light.exs", "."
<span class='console-yellow'>warning:</span> redefining module Light (current version loaded from Elixir.Light.beam)
  light.exs:1

[Light]
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Once the module is re-compiled, we can try calling <code>Light.toggle/1</code> with an empty map again:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> Light.toggle(%{})
<span class='console-red'>** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Light.toggle/1</span>

The following arguments were given to Light.toggle/1:

    # 1
    %{}

Attempted function clauses (showing 2 out of 2):

    def toggle(<span class='console-red'>%Light{status: "on"} = light</span>)
    def toggle(<span class='console-red'>%Light{status: "off"} = light</span>)

<span class='console-red'>light.exs:4: Light.toggle/1</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      This is a bit better! The error message shows us that we're passing through an empty map, but the function takes a <code>Light</code> struct instead. Let's try passing through an empty <code>Light</code> struct instead:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> Light.toggle(%Light{})
%Light{name: nil, status: "on"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      This code works! It works because the <code>Light</code> struct is configured to have a default value of <code>"off"</code> for the <code>:status</code> key within <code>light.exs</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>defmodule Light do
  defstruct [:name, status: "off"]</code></pre>

    <p>
      This means that when we write <code>%Light{}</code>, we're actually going to get back something else:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> %Light{}
  %Light{name: nil, status: "off"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is certainly a big advantage of using structs over maps: we can have keys with default values and then we can match on those default values in functions such as <code>Light.toggle/1.</code>
