  <h2 id='chapter-15'>15. Introduction to Mix</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to the final part, Part 4 of Joy of Elixir. You've done well to venture this far. The focus for this part of the book is "Real World Elixir". We're going to gather all of the things that we've learned so far and build a new Elixir project, just as we would do in the real world.

  <div class='todo'>
  * Introduction to Mix, similar in approach to the official guide, but using concepts just from this book. No agents, no supervisors, no ETS, etc.
  * Move Light & Room code from ch14 into this project
