## Chapter 1: Appeasing the masses with code

* The iex prompt
* Strings
* "REPL"
* Simple maths

## Chapter 2: Now, where did I put that value?

* Variables
* String interpolation

## Chapter 3: Lovely lists

* Why lists?
* List syntax
* Lists over multiple lines

## Chapter 4: Marvellous Maps

* Why maps?
* Map syntax
* `[]` -- accessing a value from a map
* A list containing maps

## Chapter 5: Funky functions

* "Anonymous" function definitions
* Calling anonymous functions `.()`
* Multiple argument functions
* Calling functions with wrong number of arguments
* Running code with "Elixir"

## Chapter 6: Pattern matching

* TODO: Show [head | tail] example with just a single head element.
* TODO: Redo complex pattern matching within a list, move 1 up to include whole map

* Left + Right have to be equal
* List pattern matching `[head | tail]`
* Map pattern matching by key
* Map + list combo pattern matching
* Pattern matching inside functions
* Matching maps inside functions
* Matching anything

## Chapter 7: Recap

## Chapter 8: Working with strings, input and output

### Strings

* Reversing a string
* Splitting a string
* Replacing parts of a string
* Upcase
* Downcase

### IO

* Gets
* Puts
* String.trim/1

### Immutability

* What is immutability?

## Chapter 9: Working with lists

* List.first/1
* List.last/1
* What the "/1" at the end of a function means
* The Enum module
* Enum.reverse/1
* Enum.each/2
* Enum.map/2
* BYO functions
* Enum.reduce/2
* Enum.sum/1

## Chapter 10: Working with maps

* Enum.each/2, with a map
* Tuple syntax
* Enum.map/2, with a map
* Enum.into/2

* Map.get/2
* Map.put/3
* Map.delete/2

## Chapter 11: Working with files

* IO module
* Reading files
* Writing files
* Deleting files
* Atoms
* Tuples

## Chapter 12: Finding more functions

* h helper in iex prompt
* Tab complete
* Elixir docs link

## Chapter 13: Mixing it up

* Introduction to Mix, similar in approach to the official guide, but using concepts just from this book. No agents.
* Demonstrate defining Modules
* (?) Structs?
* (?) Introduce automated testing


## Chapter 14: Where to from here?

* Link to other resources, like Programming Elixir

## (?) Concurrency chapter

THOUGHT: Is this too advanced for a beginners book?

## (?) Multi-process chapter

THOUGHT: Is this too advanced also?
